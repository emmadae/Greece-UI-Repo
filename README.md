# Greece-UI-Repo

## About

This layout was designed to be eye catching with consistent simplicity yet well developed. It is a dummy file meant to be converted into a website of choice for future usage. The inspiration for this particular piece came from Santorini, Greece. A navigation bar and multiple pages could be added to this layout for functional usage as well.
